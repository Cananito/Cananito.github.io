# Go

My Online-Go.com profile: [online-go.com/player/948468/cananito](https://online-go.com/player/948468/cananito).

I discovered Go in early 2016, shortly after I joined Google, when the company announced [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol).

TODO: 9x9:
* Get good at life and death problems. Practice at least 1 per day, ideally 10.
* Make only 2 living groups. Additional ones are likely to die and cost you the game.
* Rarely good to try and run away.
* One to three point jumps are fine when there are no enemy stones nearby. Otherwise only one point jumps are safe and in some cases two point jumps.
* Useful to learn/memorize josekis, even if you can't understand them.
