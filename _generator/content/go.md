My Online-Go.com profile: [online-go.com/player/948468/cananito](https://online-go.com/player/948468/cananito).

I discovered Go in early 2016, shortly after I joined Google, when the company announced [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol).

## Interesting Things About Go

* **Board starts empty:** TODO.
* **Only 1 piece:** TODO.
* **Scoring:** TODO.
* **Tactics vs strategy:** TODO.

## Bitesized Knowledge

### General Tips

* Learn by playing capture Go first, then 9x9, then 13x13, and finally 19x19.
* TODO: Speed of a move.
* TODO: Space for 2 eyes.

### 13x13 and 19x19 Tips

* Capture corners first, then sides, then the middle.

### 9x9 Tips

* Get good at life and death problems. Practice at least 1 per day, ideally 10.
* Make only 2 living groups. Additional ones are likely to die and cost you the game.
* Rarely good to try and run away.
* One to three point jumps are fine when there are no enemy stones nearby. Otherwise only one point jumps are safe and in some cases two point jumps.
* Useful to learn/memorize josekis, even if you can’t understand them.

### Teaching Children

Taken from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkvR-iuTkd4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkvR-iuTkd4).

* Start once they know how to learn to count to 30 and to read.
* Don’t start with theory. Start with how to capture a stone (surround liberties), concept of atari maybe, then start playing.
* When playing, let them capture your stones. But also capture theirs so they can learn how they can lose them. Defer teaching about eyes until they understand capturing well.
* Start on a smaller board.
* Teach every day, or at least every other day.
* 15-30 minutes per session since children can’t focus for long.
* Once they understand capturing well, give them kids books.
* Ideal environment is to have many children so they can play each other. Children get bored when only playing adults.
