# Personal Organization

There are 2 core parts to my personal organization: a [Bullet Journal](https://www.amazon.com/Bullet-Journal-Method-Present-Design/dp/0525533338/) and a calendar.

## Bullet Journal

I make heavy use of “BuJo”. For a brief overview of what it is, see the official site’s “Learn” section: [bulletjournal.com/pages/learn](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn).

Mine has a few modifications though:

* I use a digital version, not a physical/analog one. I really enjoyed having a physical object and using a pen, but there are a few areas where it really fell short:
    * Writing down URLs. You really need copy paste for these.
    * Searching. My “Monthly Log” + “Daily Log” collections tend to grow a lot, so quickly finding things became a real hassle.
    * Expanding previous bullets. I managed to embrace the lack of bullet rearranging, but I often found myself needing to expand existing tasks or notes with sub-bullets to provide additional context.
    * Cloud back-up. It’s comforting to know that my BuJo won’t get stolen, damaged, or lost.
* I don’t use the “Index” collection.
* I don’t use the “Calendar Page” in the “Monthly Log” collection.
    * I use a proper calendar for this instead (see “Calendar” section below).
* I don't use “event” bullets (`o`).
    * I never quite understood how they’re supposed to be used, so instead I treat past unscheduled events as “notes” (`-`) and use a proper calendar for future scheduled events.
* I don’t use “signifiers”.
* For “task” bullets, I use the original 5, plus 2 of my own:
    * “Task incomplete” (`*`).
    * “Task complete” (`x`).
    * “Task migrated forward to the next month” (`>`).
    * “Task migrated back to the Future Log” (`<`).
    * “Task canceled” (`~`).
    * “Task migrated down to a newer Daily log” (`v`).
    * “Task migrated up to the Monthly Log” (`^`).

I try to capture any task in my BuJo, no matter how small it is, and as soon as possible. If a task is broad and generic, I later take the time to break it down into multiple sub-tasks (indented bullets). And for certain tasks, I add additional context as nested notes. Example:

<pre><code>
* Replace sofa.
  x Order new sofa online.
    - https://some-website.com/sofa777
  ~ Dump old sofa.
  * Give old sofa to Alice and Bob.
    - Tel: (123) 456-7890
</code></pre>

I also try to capture as a note any meaninful thought (funny, emotional, contextual, etc.), event, article (with sub-notes with my thoughts), information, etc.

When it comes to emotional thoughts, it’s pretty useful to capture them so I can “get it off my chest” without having to vent with someone and avoid doing something stupid or reckless. In a few cases I can also come back later and decide whether I want to add a task or a note with my final/cooler thought(s).

### Digital Set-Up

I use my computer, a text editor (vim) and `.txt` files, a cloud file storage service (Google Drive) to synchronize across computers, and a notes app (Keep) to quickly capture things with my smartphone while I’m on the go and transfer them to my computer later.

The directory and file structure I follow the following example:

<pre><code>
BuJo/
├── 2020
│   ├── 00-FutureLog.txt
│   ├── 01-January.txt
│   ├── ...
│   └── 12-December.txt
├── 2021
│   ├── 00-FutureLog.txt
│   ├── 01-January.txt
│   ├── ...
│   └── 12-December.txt
└── Collections
    ├── Books.txt
    ├── Golf.txt
    └── Wine.txt
</code></pre>

## Calendar

I use a proper calendar (Google Calendar) since—for me—BuJo fell short on calendaring and reminders, specifically:

* Harder to access compared to my smartphone.
* Harder to open up the event’s address in the map app (Google Maps). This is specially needed when driving to avoid typing in the address.
* Harder to visualize time slots.
* Lack of notifications minutes prior to the event.
* Harder to share the event with someone.

I try to capture all significant events in my calendar (appointments, social events and outings, haircuts, flights, birthdays, meetings, etc.).
