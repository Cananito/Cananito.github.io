## Barbell Strength Training

Nowadays most of my exercising comes from barbell strength training. I was drawn to it because of the simplicity of the workouts, but I’ve come to appreciate other aspects of it:

* It’s the the only way to maximize overall strength.
* It doesn’t require as much space as dumbbells, kettlebells, or machines.
* Because you only do 1-5 reps per set, you don't end up with soreness (DOMS) like with hypertrophy and endurance training.

### Lifts and Exercises

The main lifts I do are:

* Squat.
* Deadlift.
* Strict press.
* Bench press. 

As assistance:

* Barbell curls.
* Chin ups.
* Dips (not really doing them, but planning to do so once I get the proper equipment).

Less frequently, as variations, or just for fun:

* Front squat.
* Overhead squat.
* Power clean.
* Hang clean pull.
* Barbell row.
* Behind-the-neck squat jerk.
* Behind-the-neck push press.
