## Barbell Training

Nowadays most of my exercising comes from barbell training. Compared to other implements (dumbbells, kettlebells, machines, etc.), barbells have some key advantages:

* It’s the the only way to maximize overall strength because the upper limit on weight is so much higher.
* It doesn’t require as much space.

### Lifts and Exercises

The main lifts I do are:

* Squat.
* Deadlift.
* Strict press.

Less frequently, as assistance, as variations, or just for fun:

* Barbell curls.
* Chin ups.
* Dips.
* Squat variations.
    * Front squat.
    * Overhead squat.
* Power clean.
* Pull variations.
    * Clean pull.
    * Hang clean pull.
* Barbell row.
* Press/jerk variations.
    * Push press.
    * Push jerk.
    * Behind-the-neck strict press.
    * Behind-the-neck push press.
    * Behind-the-neck push jerk.
* Bench press. 

### Programming

My primary goal is to get stronger, secondarily to have a good physique. Thus I prioritize strength training (1-5 reps with heavy weight). But when I hit a plateau, have an injury, or experience any discomfort, I do incorporate some hypertrophy (6-10 reps), complexes as aerobic exercise (3-6 back-to-back multi-rep exercises), and very rarely endurance training (10+ reps).

### Running

I really dislike the feeling of being short of breath when doing any type of routine/daily activity, so I like to incorporate some aerobic exercise throughout the week. For this I like running indoors on a treadmill for 15-30 mins.

### Streteching

I try to stretch once or twice a day, specially my upper back since it tends to get pretty tight from the barbell training. As a side effect, it relaxes and unstresses my body, and it makes me feel I gain mobility.
