## Barbell Training

Nowadays most of my exercising comes from barbell training. Compared to other implements (dumbbells, kettlebells, machines, etc.), barbells have some key advantages:

* It’s the the only way to maximize overall strength because the upper limit on weight is so much higher.
* It doesn’t require as much space.

### Lifts and Exercises

The main lifts I do are:

* Squat.
* Deadlift.
* Strict press.

Less frequently, as assistance, as variations, or just for fun: barbell curls, bench press, squat variations, pull variations, press/jerk variations, barbell row, power clean, chin ups, dips.

### Programming

My primary goal is to get stronger, secondarily to have a good physique. Thus I prioritize strength training (1-5 reps with heavy weight). But when I hit a plateau, have an injury, or experience any discomfort, I do incorporate some hypertrophy (6-10 reps), complexes as aerobic exercise (3-6 back-to-back multi-rep exercises), and very rarely endurance training (10+ reps).

### Why strength?

It’s easy to find studies showing that greater muscle mass and/or strength correlates to an increase in longevity. It’s also the case that while muscle mass correlates with strength, [it’s not directly proportional](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/size-vs-strength/), muscle mass is just one of many factors—but likely the biggest one the more trained you are. It’s thus hard to say which is more important for longevity: muscle mass or strength. For convenience, I choose to focus on strength, given that it’s easier and cheaper to increase and maintain than muscle.

## Why not bench press?

## Running

I really dislike the feeling of being short of breath when doing any type of low-medium intensity activity, so I like to incorporate some [aerobic](https://fitbod.me/blog/cardio-aerobic-anaerobic/) exercise throughout the week. For this I like running indoors on a treadmill for 15-30 mins.

## Stretching

I try to stretch once or twice a day, specially my upper back since it tends to get pretty tight from the barbell training. As a side effect, it relaxes and unstresses my body, and it makes me feel I gain mobility.
