## Barbell Training

Nowadays most of my exercising comes from barbell training. Compared to other implements (dumbbells, kettlebells, machines, etc.), barbells have some key advantages:

* It’s the the only way to maximize overall strength because the upper limit on weight is so much higher.
* It doesn’t require as much space.

### Lifts and Exercises

The main lifts I do are:

* Squat.
* Deadlift.
* Strict press.
* Bench press (I intend to demote this lift once I’m able to do loadable dips). 

As assistance:

* Barbell curls.
* Chin ups.
* Dips (not really doing them, but planning to do so once I get the proper equipment).

Less frequently, as variations, or just for fun:

* Front squat.
* Overhead squat.
* Power clean.
* Hang clean pull.
* Barbell row.
* Behind-the-neck squat jerk.
* Behind-the-neck push press.

### Programming

My primary goal is to get stronger, secondarily to have a good physique. Thus I prioritize strength training (1-5 reps with heavy weight). But when I hit a plateau, have an injury, or experience any discomfort, I do incorporate some hypertrophy (6-10 reps), complexes as cardio (3-6 back-to-back multi-rep exercises), and very rarely endurance training (10+ reps).
