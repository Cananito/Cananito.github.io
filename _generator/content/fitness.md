## Barbell Strength Training

Nowadays most of my exercising comes from barbell strength training. I was drawn to it because of the simplicity of the workouts, but I’ve come to appreciate other aspects like the fact that it’s the the only way to maximize overall strength and that it doesn’t require as much space as dumbbells, kettlebells, or machines.

The main lifts I do are:

* Squat.
* Deadlift.
* Overhead press.
* Bench press. 

Less frequently and/or as assistance:

* Chin ups.
* Barbell row.
* Barbell curls.
* Front squat.
* Overhead squat.
* Hang clean pull.
