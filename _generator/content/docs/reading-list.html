    I thought I wouldn't enjoy mystery books but this made me realize I do. The audiobook format wasn't great though, specially the beginning of the book.<br />

    Went into this one for the golf, but it had a ton of Irish history which I found very interesting.

    Went expecting to learn and be educated, but since the format of the book was a letter to the author's son it it didn't lend itself for that. I also found myself disagreeing more often than not.

    Had me nodding throughout, even though I didn't learn anything particularly groundbreaking. A lot of people would probably be turned off by the "bro" style of the author but I really enjoyed it and laughed a lot.
</p>
<p>
    For some reason the thing that stuck with me the most for no particular reason was this part where he talks about the difference between fault and responsibility. That there are things that are not your fault but are your responsibility, and you shouldn’t deal with them by blaming and blaming and blaming whoever was at fault. Some examples he gives are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Someone drops a baby at your door, now it’s your responsibility to deal with it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your partner dumps you, now it's your responsibility to figure out how to stop being miserable.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Then he takes it to more touchy areas like life tragedies, disabilities, etc.
