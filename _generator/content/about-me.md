## Education

I studied **Computer Science** at **CETYS Universidad** (Tijuana campus) from 2008 to 2012.

I went to high school to ‚Äúla L√°zaro‚Äù (Preparatoria Federal L√°zaro C√°rdenas) from 2005 to 2008, taking the ‚ÄúComputing‚Äù specialty.

## Personal Life

I was **born December 15, 1989** in in **San Diego, CA**, but **raised** in **Tijuana, Mexico**. I also have Mexican citizenship via my parents. I can speak **Spanish** (first language) and **English**, and hope to learn Mandarin some day to be able to [speak with over 20% of the world in their native language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers) üòÅ.

I lived in **Tijuana** from birth to Jun 2012, **Mount Shasta** from Jun 2012 to Oct 2013, **Chula Vista** (San Diego) from Oct 2013 to Feb 2016, **Mountain View** from Feb 2016 to Jun 2022, and back again in **Chula Vista** since Jun 2022.

### Interests

Outside of working, parenting, and doing chores, my interests include:

* Computer science and [software](software.html) engineering.
* [Golf](golf.html).
* [Working out](fitness.html).
* Reading [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/). I‚Äôve had the digital + print subscription since Jun 2020 and try to read most of the articles from the weekly issue. I particularly like The Economist because it‚Äôs weekly (so easy to keep up with), has global coverage (so big bang for the buck), and aligns with my political views the most.
* Reading books.

### Why ‚Äúcananito‚Äù?

They used to call my grandfather "Canano" because they thought he looked like he was from Cananea (no clue why). Then when I was a kid, a couple of family members thought I looked a lot like my grandfather, so they started calling me "Cananito", which is the diminutive form of "Canano" in Spanish.
