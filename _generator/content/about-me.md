## Education

I studied **Computer Science** at **CETYS Universidad** (Tijuana campus) from 2008 to 2012.

I went to high school to ‚Äúla L√°zaro‚Äù (Preparatoria Federal L√°zaro C√°rdenas) from 2005 to 2008, taking the ‚ÄúComputing‚Äù specialty.

## Personal Life

I was **born December 15, 1989** in in **San Diego, CA**, but **raised** in **Tijuana, Mexico**. I also have Mexican citizenship via my parents. I can speak **Spanish** (first language) and **English**, and hope to learn Mandarin some day to be able to [speak with over 20% of the world in their native language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers) üòÅ.

### Interests

Outside of working, parenting, and doing chores, my interests include:

* Reading [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/). I‚Äôve had the digital + print subscription since Jun 2020 and try to read most of the articles from the weekly issue. I particularly like The Economist because it‚Äôs weekly (so easy to keep up with), has global coverage (so big bang for the buck), and aligns with my political views the most.
* [Working out](fitness.html).
* Computer science and [software](software.html) engineering.
* Reading [books](books.html).
* Playing [Go](go.html).
* [Golf](golf.html). Mostly playing it, sometimes watching it.
* Football (soccer). Mostly following it, sometimes watching it, but not playing it (too afraid of injuring myself). My favorite leagues/tournaments are England‚Äôs Premier League, the UEFA Champions League, and the FIFA World Cup. My favorite team is Manchester United.
* Watching YouTube, TV, and movies.

### Why ‚Äúcananito‚Äù?

They used to call my grandfather "Canano" because they thought he looked like he was from Cananea (no clue why). Then when I was a kid, a couple of family members thought I looked a lot like my grandfather, so they started calling me "Cananito", which is the diminutive form of "Canano" in Spanish.
