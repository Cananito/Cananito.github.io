        <h1>Fitness</h1>
        <h2>Barbell Training</h2>
        <p>Nowadays most of my exercising comes from barbell training. Compared to other implements (dumbbells, kettlebells, machines, etc.), barbells have some key advantages:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>It’s the the only way to maximize overall strength because the upper limit on weight is so much higher.</li>
        <li>It doesn’t require as much space.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lifts and Exercises</h3>
        <p>The main lifts I do are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Squat.</li>
        <li>Deadlift.</li>
        <li>Strict press.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Less frequently, as assistance, as variations, or just for fun: barbell curls, bench press, squat variations, pull variations, press/jerk variations, barbell row, power clean, chin ups, dips.</p>
        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>My primary goal is to get stronger, secondarily to have a good physique. Thus I prioritize strength training (1-5 reps with heavy weight). But when I hit a plateau, have an injury, or experience any discomfort, I do incorporate some hypertrophy (6-10 reps), complexes as aerobic exercise (3-6 back-to-back multi-rep exercises), and very rarely endurance training (10+ reps).</p>
        <h3>Why strength?</h3>
        <p>It’s easy to find studies showing that greater muscle mass and/or strength correlates to an increase in longevity. It’s also the case that while muscle mass correlates with strength, <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/size-vs-strength/">it’s not directly proportional</a>, muscle mass is just one of many factors—but likely the biggest one the more trained you are. It’s thus hard to say which is more important for longevity: muscle mass or strength. For convenience, I choose to focus on strength, given that it’s easier and cheaper to increase and maintain than muscle.</p>
        <h2>Why not bench press?</h2>
        <p>TODO</p>
        <h2>Running</h2>
        <p>I really dislike the feeling of being short of breath when doing any type of low-medium intensity activity, so I like to incorporate some <a href="https://fitbod.me/blog/cardio-aerobic-anaerobic/">aerobic</a> exercise throughout the week. For this I like running indoors on a treadmill for 15-30 mins.</p>
        <h2>Stretching</h2>
        <p>I try to stretch once or twice a day, specially my upper back since it tends to get pretty tight from the barbell training. As a side effect, it relaxes and unstresses my body, and it makes me feel I gain mobility.</p>
