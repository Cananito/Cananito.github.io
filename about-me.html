        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I studied <strong>Computer Science</strong> at <strong>CETYS Universidad</strong> (Tijuana campus) from 2008 to 2012.</p>
        <p>I went to high school to ‚Äúla L√°zaro‚Äù (Preparatoria Federal L√°zaro C√°rdenas) from 2005 to 2008, taking the ‚ÄúComputing‚Äù specialty.</p>
        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>I was <strong>born December 15, 1989</strong> in in <strong>San Diego, CA</strong>, but <strong>raised</strong> in <strong>Tijuana, Mexico</strong>. I also have Mexican citizenship via my parents. I can speak <strong>Spanish</strong> (first language) and <strong>English</strong>, and hope to learn Mandarin some day to be able to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers">speak with over 20% of the world in their native language</a> üòÅ.</p>
        <p>I lived in <strong>Tijuana</strong> from birth to Jun 2012, <strong>Mount Shasta</strong> from Jun 2012 to Oct 2013, <strong>Chula Vista</strong> (San Diego) from Oct 2013 to Feb 2016, <strong>Mountain View</strong> from Feb 2016 to Jun 2022, and back again in <strong>Chula Vista</strong> since Jun 2022.</p>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>Outside of working, parenting, and doing chores, my interests include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Reading <a href="https://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a>. I‚Äôve had the digital + print subscription since Jun 2020 and try to read most of the articles from the weekly issue. I particularly like The Economist because it‚Äôs weekly (so easy to keep up with), has global coverage (so big bang for the buck), and aligns with my political views the most.</li>
        <li><a href="fitness.html">Working out</a>.</li>
        <li>Reading <a href="books.html">books</a>.</li>
        <li>Playing <a href="go.html">Go</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="golf.html">Golf</a>. Mostly playing it, sometimes watching it. My favorite events are the 4 majors, the Ryder Cup, and LIV Golf.</li>
        <li>Computer science.</li>
        <li>Football (soccer). Mostly following it, sometimes watching it, but not playing it (too afraid of injuring myself). My favorite leagues/tournaments are England‚Äôs Premier League, the UEFA Champions League, and the FIFA World Cup. My favorite teams are Manchester United and the England national team.</li>
        <li>Watching YouTube, TV, and movies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why ‚Äúcananito‚Äù?</h3>
        <p>They used to call my grandfather &quot;Canano&quot; because they thought he looked like he was from Cananea (no clue why). Then when I was a kid, a couple of family members thought I looked a lot like my grandfather, so they started calling me &quot;Cananito&quot;, which is the diminutive form of &quot;Canano&quot; in Spanish.</p>
