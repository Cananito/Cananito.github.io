        <h1>Personal Organization</h1>
        <p>There are 2 core parts to my personal organization: a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bullet-Journal-Method-Present-Design/dp/0525533338/">Bullet Journal</a> and a calendar.</p>
        <h2>Bullet Journal</h2>
        <p>I make heavy use of “BuJo”. For a brief overview of what it is, see the official site’s “Learn” section: <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn">bulletjournal.com/pages/learn</a>.</p>
        <p>Mine has a few modifications though:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I use a digital version, not a physical/analog one. I really enjoyed having a physical object and using a pen (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K3KRJK6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title">Sakura Pigma Micron 01s</a> are the best!), but there are a few areas where it really fell short:<ul>
        <li>Writing down URLs. You really need copy paste for these.</li>
        <li>Using it in the dark. It’s often a big hassle to find light during the night.</li>
        <li>Searching. My “Monthly Log” + “Daily Log” collections tend to grow a lot, so quickly finding things became a real hassle.</li>
        <li>Expanding previous bullets. I managed to embrace the lack of bullet rearranging, but I often found myself needing to expand existing tasks or notes with sub-bullets to provide additional context.</li>
        <li>Cloud back-up. It’s comforting to know that my BuJo won’t get stolen, damaged, or lost.</li>
        <li>Having to carry around one more thing.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I don’t use the “Index” collection.</li>
        <li>I don’t use the “Calendar Page” in the “Monthly Log” collection.<ul>
        <li>I use a proper calendar for this instead (see “Calendar” section below).</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I don’t use “event” bullets (<code>o</code>).<ul>
        <li>I never quite understood how they’re supposed to be used, so instead I treat past unscheduled events as “notes” (<code>-</code>) and use a proper calendar for future scheduled events.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I don’t use “signifiers”.</li>
        <li>For “task” bullets, I use the original 5, plus 2 of my own:<ul>
        <li>“Task incomplete” (<code>*</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task complete” (<code>x</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task migrated forward to the next month” (<code>&gt;</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task migrated back to the Future Log” (<code>&lt;</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task canceled” (<code>~</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task migrated down to a newer Daily log” (<code>v</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task migrated up to the Monthly Log” (<code>^</code>).</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I try to capture any task in my BuJo, no matter how small it is, and as soon as possible. If a task is broad and generic, I later take the time to break it down into multiple sub-tasks (indented bullets). And for certain tasks, I add additional context as nested notes. Example:</p>
        <pre><code>
* Replace sofa.
  x Order new sofa online.
    - https://some-website.com/sofa777
  ~ Dump old sofa.
  * Give old sofa to Alice and Bob.
    - Tel: (123) 456-7890
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>I also try to capture as a note any meaninful thought (funny, emotional, contextual, etc.), event, article (with sub-notes with my thoughts), information, etc.</p>
        <p>When it comes to emotional thoughts, it’s pretty useful to capture them so I can “get it off my chest” without having to vent with someone and avoid doing something stupid or reckless. In a few cases I can also come back later and decide whether I want to add a task or a note with my final/cooler thought(s).</p>
        <h3>Digital Set-Up</h3>
        <p>I use my computer, a text editor (vim) and <code>.txt</code> files, a cloud file storage service (Google Drive) to synchronize across computers, and a notes app (Keep) to quickly capture things with my smartphone while I’m on the go and transfer them to my computer later.</p>
        <p>The directory and file structure I follow the following example:</p>
        <pre><code>
BuJo/
├── 2020
│   ├── 00-FutureLog.txt
│   ├── 01-January.txt
│   ├── ...
│   └── 12-December.txt
├── 2021
│   ├── 00-FutureLog.txt
│   ├── 01-January.txt
│   ├── ...
│   └── 12-December.txt
└── Collections
    ├── Books.txt
    ├── Golf.txt
    └── Wine.txt
        </code></pre>
        
        <h2>Calendar</h2>
        <p>I use a proper calendar (Google Calendar) since—for me—BuJo fell short on calendaring and reminders, specifically:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Harder to access compared to my smartphone.</li>
        <li>Harder to open up the event’s address in the map app (Google Maps). This is specially needed when driving to avoid typing in the address.</li>
        <li>Harder to visualize time slots.</li>
        <li>Lack of notifications minutes prior to the event.</li>
        <li>Harder to share the event with someone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I try to capture all significant events in my calendar (appointments, social events and outings, haircuts, flights, birthdays, meetings, etc.).</p>
