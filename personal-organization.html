        <h1>Personal Organization</h1>
        <p><span id="last-updated">Last updated: Dec 21, 2025</span></p>
        <p>There are 2 core parts to my personal organization: a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bullet-Journal-Method-Present-Design/dp/0525533338/">Bullet Journal</a> and a calendar.</p>
        <h2>Bullet Journal</h2>
        <p>I make heavy use of “BuJo”. For a brief overview of what it is, see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM">How to Bullet Journal</a> video.</p>
        <p>Mine has a few modifications though:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I use a pocket notebook for “Daily Logs” and a digital version for “Monthly Logs” and “Collections” insead of a regular sized notebook for everything for the following reasons:<ul>
        <li>Harder to carry around a regular sized notebook everywhere. I always have my pocket notebook and pen with me.</li>
        <li>Writing down URLs. You really need copy paste for these. So I put these in my digital “Monthly Log”.</li>
        <li>Searching. My “Monthly Logs” tend to have a lot of reference material, so quickly finding things became a real hassle.</li>
        <li>Expanding previous bullets. I managed to embrace the lack of bullet rearranging, but I often found myself preferring to expand existing tasks or notes with sub-bullets in the digital version to keep information centralized a bit more.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I use the “Monthly Log” to add URL-based entries (like a link to an article and relevant quotes).</li>
        <li>I don’t use the “Index” collection.</li>
        <li>I don’t use the “Calendar Page” in the “Monthly Log” collection.<ul>
        <li>I use a proper calendar for this instead (see “Calendar” section below).</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I don’t use “event” bullets (<code>o</code>).<ul>
        <li>I never quite understood how they’re supposed to be used, so instead I treat past unscheduled events as “notes” (<code>-</code>) and use a proper calendar for future scheduled events.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I don’t use “signifiers”.</li>
        <li>For “task” bullets, I use the original 5, plus 2 of my own:<ul>
        <li>“Task incomplete” (<code>*</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task complete” (<code>x</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task migrated forward to the next month” (<code>&gt;</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task migrated back from the Monthly Log to the Future Log” (<code>&lt;</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task migrated back from the Daily Log to the Monthly Log” (<code>&lt;</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task canceled” (<code>~</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task migrated down to a newer Daily log” (<code>v</code>).</li>
        <li>“Task migrated up to the Monthly Log” (<code>^</code>).</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I try to capture any task in my pocket notebook “Daily Log” first (no matter how small it is and as soon as possible). Example:</p>
        <pre><code>
* replace sofa
        </code></pre>
        <p>If it's a task large enough that it needs breaking down, I then proceed to migrate it to my digital “Monthly Log” and break it down into multiple sub-tasks as indented bullets and with additional context as nested notes. Example:</p>
        <pre><code>
* Replace sofa.
  x Order new sofa online.
    - https://some-website.com/sofa777
  ~ Dump old sofa.
  * Give old sofa to Alice and Bob.
    - Tel: (123) 456-7890
        </code></pre>
        <p>I also migrate tasks from my pocket notebook in 2 other situations. When I do the digital monthly migration, I go over my pocket notebook tasks and migrate ones that are starting to become old (2+ weeks). When I fill up the pocket notebook and going to start a new one, I migrate all of the tasks.</p>
        <p>I also try to capture as a note any meaninful thought (funny, emotional, contextual, etc.), event, article (with sub-notes with my thoughts), information, etc.</p>
        <p>When it comes to emotional thoughts, it’s pretty useful to capture them so I can “get it off my chest” without having to vent with someone and avoid doing something stupid or reckless. In a few cases I can also come back later and decide whether I want to add a task or a note with my final/cooler thought(s).</p>
        <h3>Pocket Notebook Set-Up</h3>
        <p>I use <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a> pocket notebooks and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K3KRJK6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title">Sakura Pigma Micron 01s</a> pens.</p>
        <h3>Digital Set-Up</h3>
        <p>I use my computer, a text editor (vim) and <code>.txt</code> files, and a cloud file storage service to synchronize across computers (GitHub).</p>
        <p>The directory and file structure I follow the following example:</p>
        <pre><code>
notebooks/
├── 2020
│   ├── 00-future-log.txt
│   ├── 01-january.txt
│   ├── ...
│   └── 12-december.txt
├── 2021
│   ├── 00-future-log.txt
│   ├── 01-january.txt
│   ├── ...
│   └── 12-december.txt
├── books.txt
├── golf.txt
└── recipes.txt
        </code></pre>
        <h2>Calendar</h2>
        <p>I use a proper calendar (Google Calendar) since—for me—BuJo fell short on calendaring and reminders, specifically:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Harder to open up the event’s address in the map app (Google Maps). This is specially needed when driving to avoid typing in the address.</li>
        <li>Harder to visualize time slots.</li>
        <li>Lack of notifications minutes prior to the event.</li>
        <li>Harder to share the event with someone.</li>
        <li>Not practical for rescheduling often, which tends to happen much more nowadays.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I try to capture all significant events in my calendar (appointments, social events and outings, haircuts, flights, birthdays, meetings, etc.).</p>
