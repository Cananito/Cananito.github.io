        <h3>2021</h3>
        <p><strong>Go: A Complete Introduction to the Game</strong> ~ Cho Chikun<br />

        <p>Could’ve been my obsession with learning and playing Go, but really enjoyed this book and super excited to continue learning and playing. It interweaves the teaching chapters with cultural ones: history and adoption around the world, tournament scene, equipment, intelligence benefits, computer bots, and a ton of resources to continue learning and improving.</p>
        <p>The only complaint I have is that the book has a few mistakes. The ones I found are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Page 88 (Chapter Eight: Life and Death): “<strike>Black</strike><strong>White</strong> then makes a placement with 3, killing the black group.”</li>
        <li>Page 123 (Chapter Eleven: An Example Game): “Figure 3 (31-64)” is missing moves 63 Black and 64 White. They’re supposed to appear 2 rows below move 60 White (see “Figure 4 (65-80)” for exact placement).</li>
        <li>Page 134 (Go Books from Kiseido): “Most <strike>u</strike><strong>i</strong>ssues from #72 on are available and many earlier issues are also available.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Circe</strong> ~ Madeline Miller<br />

        <p>Was expecting this to be a Greek mythology version of Neil Gaiman’s “Norse Mythology”, but it felt more drama than action. Perhaps I would’ve enjoyed it more if I had been more familiar with Greek mythology. I did thoroughly enjoy the chapter around Pasiphaë and the bull.</p>
        <p><strong>Ready Player Two</strong> ~ Ernest Cline<br />

        <p>Enjoyed the first book way more than this one. I liked the worldbuilding, but thought the ending was “meh” and that the book had too many “woke” / socially progressive elements.</p>
        <p><strong>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</strong> (audiobook) ~ Neil Gaiman<br />
        Started: 2021/Jan/18<br />

        <p>I'm pretty glad I read this as an audiobook, otherwise I'm not sure I would've finished it. I felt there was a lot of potential to expand on the magic, but instead it was just a bunch of bizarre stuff, a pretty underwhelming plot, and a very “meh” ending.</p>
        <p><strong>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</strong> (audiobook) ~ Agatha Christie<br />
        Started: 2021/Jan/16<br />
        Finished: 2021/Jan/18<br />

        <p>I thought I wouldn't enjoy mystery books but this made me realize I do. The audiobook format wasn't great though, specially the beginning of the book.</p>
        <h3>2020</h3>
        <p><strong>A Course Called Ireland</strong> ~ Tom Coyne<br />
        Started: 2020/Aug/09<br />
        Finished: 2020/Dec/31<br />
        Rating: 4/5</p>
        <p>Went into this one for the golf, but it had a ton of Irish history which I found very interesting.</p>
        <p><strong>A Clash of Kings</strong> ~ George R. R. Martin<br />
        Started: 2019/Nov/25<br />
        Finished: 2020/Aug/09<br />

        <p>Continuing to enjoy the series!</p>
        <p><strong>Between the World and Me</strong> ~ Ta-Nehisi Coates<br />
        Started: 2020/Feb/02<br />
        Finished: 2020/Feb/09<br />
        Rating: 2.5/5</p>
        <p>Went expecting to learn and be educated, but since the format of the book was a letter to the author's son it it didn't lend itself for that. I also found myself disagreeing more often than not.</p>
        <h3>2019</h3>
        <p><strong>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck</strong> ~ Mark Manson<br />
        Started: 2019/Dec/21<br />
        Finished: 2019/Dec/31<br />
        Rating: 5/5</p>
        <p>Had me nodding throughout, even though I didn't learn anything particularly groundbreaking. A lot of people would probably be turned off by the “bro” style of the author but I really enjoyed it and laughed a lot.</p>
        <p>For some reason the thing that stuck with me the most for no particular reason was this part where he talks about the difference between fault and responsibility. That there are things that are not your fault but are your responsibility, and you shouldn’t deal with them by blaming and blaming and blaming whoever was at fault. Some examples he gives are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Someone drops a baby at your door, now it’s your responsibility to deal with it.</li>
        <li>Your partner dumps you, now it's your responsibility to figure out how to stop being miserable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then he takes it to more touchy areas like life tragedies, disabilities, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong> ~ George R. R. Martin<br />

        <p>Background: I watched the first episode and the last season of TV series (was supposed to binge watch all seasons prior to the last one but no time) and thinking it was executed horribly, but I really got into the world. So after concluding that thre's almost no movie or TV series that executes better than books, I decided not to go back and watch the rest of the Game of Thrones TV series and instead read the books.</p>
        <p>Despite the language being somewhat hard for me to follow, I really got into it. Can't wait to read all the books!</p>
        <p><strong>The Bullet Journal Method</strong> ~ Ryder Carroll<br />
        Started: 2019/Aug<br />
        Finished: 2019/Oct/11<br />
        Rating: 4/5</p>
        <p>Some amazing organizational and productivity ideas. Fan of the minimalism and the technique, but wasn't a fan of the more touchy feely stuff.</p>
        <p>I bought notebooks and pens, used them for several months, but ended up switching to a digital version of BuJo.</p>
        <p><strong>Tiger Woods</strong> ~ Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian<br />
        Started: 2019/Apr/04<br />
        Finished: 2019/Jul<br />
        Rating: 4/5</p>
        <p>Read most of it with a grain of salt—it's always hard to know what's fact and what's not—but very insightful. Made me like Tiger less as a person, but more as an athlete.</p>
        <p><strong>Ready Player One</strong> ~ Ernest Cline<br />
        Started: 2019<br />
        Finished: 2019<br />
        Rating: 5/5</p>
        <p>Loved the geekdom and how life would be if everyone had to live in a digital world. Definitely reading the sequel(s).</p>
        <p><strong>Norse Mythology</strong> ~ Neil Gaiman<br />
        Started: 2019<br />
        Finished: 2019<br />
        Rating: 4/5</p>
        <p>Went in interested because I wanted to learn more about Thor, Odin, and Loki. What I really enjoyed was that you could read chapters as standalone.</p>
        <h3>2018</h3>
        <p><strong>Born a Crime</strong> ~ Trevor Noah<br />
        Started: 2018<br />
        Finished: 2018<br />
        Rating: 5/5</p>
        <p>This is probably going to be one of my favorite books for a long while. It was pretty funny, learned a lot about South Africa, and it has a good few paragraphs about economic justice (pages 186-190, about the CD writer). The funniest parts were most interactions with his mother and the concert at a school with the kid called Hitler.</p>
        <h3>2013</h3>
        <p><strong>REMOTE</strong> ~ David Heinemeier Hansson and Jason Fried<br />
        Started: 2013<br />
        Finished: 2013<br />
        Rating: 4/5</p>
        <p>Read this at a time when I was very opposed to working out of an office. The book is obviously very opinionated in favor of remote work, and not sure how objective it is, despite all the evidence they show.</p>
        <h3>2001</h3>
        <p><strong>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</strong> ~ J. K. Rowling<br />
        Started: 2001<br />
        Finished: 2001<br />
        Rating: 5/5</p>
        <p>First book I remember comprehending from start to finish.</p>
        <h3>????</h3>
        <p><strong>Viajes de Gulliver</strong> ~ Jonathan Swift  </p>
        <p>This is the book I remember the most out of all my child reads (I never finished most of them).</p>
        <p><strong>Colmillo blanco</strong> ~ Jack London  </p>
        <p>I remember reading this book for a 6th grade class, but recall very little. I do remember liking it a lot.</p>
